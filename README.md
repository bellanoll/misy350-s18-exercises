we use this file to practice markdown

we have tried:
1. `git clone`: this is how you download a repo
2. `git status`: this shows the status of the current repo
3. `git add .`: this stages all changes
4. `git commit -am "msg"`: this commits the changes to the Repo
5. `git log`:this shows all commits
6. `git checkout hash (c188393)`: this goes back to the commit with hash
7. `git checkout master`: this goes back to latest commits
8. `git push`: this will push every additional changes made to GitHub
